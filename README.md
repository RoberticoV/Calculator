<p>In this video you can see various operations being performed by the user clicking on the on-screen buttons. Although it does not show, the app is also able to take in information from the user's keyboard as well.</p>

<h3>Keyboard Functionality</h3>
<ul>
  <p>enter: performs the same function as if clicking the "=" sign on the screen</p>
  <p>backspace: allows the user to backtrack. If a key was mistakenly pressed, "backspace" deletes the most recent selection without having to make the user start all over with their expression</p>
</ul>
